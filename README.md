# 🌿 GHOST GREENS

*GHOST GREENS* is a creative health-based initiative that helps children eat healthy *without seeing the veggies* — blending nutrition, fun, and education into one engaging ecosystem.

The project combines a *physical product* (vegetable powder) with a *digital app* (the GREEN App) to transform how kids and parents approach healthy eating.

## 🧩 Overview

### The Problem
Getting kids to eat their vegetables has always been a struggle. Parents often resort to:
- Hiding vegetables in meals  
- Using threats or rewards  
- Creating distractions or pranks  

Despite these efforts, the idea that “healthy foods are bitter” persists among children.

### The Solution
*GHOST GREENS* introduces a new way of thinking:
- A *fun, interactive, and tasty approach* to healthy eating.  
- A *blend of physical and digital experiences* that educate, entertain, and reward both kids and parents.

### 1. The Physical Product

Each pack includes:
- *Mini quizzes and puzzles* printed on packaging  
- *Encrypted codes* to be entered in the GREEN App for rewards

*GHOST GREENS* was inspired by the *Halloween season, symbolizing the idea of *“ghosting the bitterness” in healthy foods — making vegetables disappear while keeping all their nutritional goodness.
