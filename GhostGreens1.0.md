# 🌿 GHOST GREENS

*Yep! You read that right.*  
Now imagine eating healthy… *without seeing the veggies.*

## 🕵‍♀ DISCOVERY

Growing up as young kids, the tendency to only navigate towards the sweet foods was something we all experienced.  
No one wanted to go through the process of eating our veggies — the onions, spinach, lettuce, and even the famous pumpkin leaves we all know as ‘ugwu’ leaves.  
The most hated one being the bitterleaf.

Over the years, parents have tried all sorts of creative ways to get their kids to eat vegetables —  
from *pranking* them into eating, to *blending veggies* into meals, *threatening punishment, or showing them **videos of other kids eating them*.

One way or another, it’s a general question every parent asks:  
> *How do we get them to eat their veggies?*

Products were developed to help people and kids eat healthy —  
from *salads, to **vitamin C supplements* like Nutri-C, to *dissolvable food supplements* and *healthy shakes* (which are basically just ground veggies).

After careful consideration, an idea came:
> Why don’t we build a product to help combine carefully selected vegetables (kale, carrots, peas, cabbages, etc.) to help parents?

And that’s how *GHOST GREENS* came to life —  
(inspired by the Halloween season 🎃)

## 🧩 BUILD

*GHOST GREENS* is targeted at changing the belief in kids that “healthy foods are bitter”  
while reducing the mental and emotional strain on parents trying to get their kids to eat healthy.

The *physical product* is a finely ground vegetable powder made using *low-heat drying* and *micro milling* of 100% natural and organic raw materials —  
fresh vegetables like *carrots, bitterleaf, and spinach*.

Raw materials are *naturally grown*, ensuring all health standards are met and contamination is minimized.

After proper processing, *product packaging* will contain *little quizzes and puzzles* that can be filled into the digital product — the *GREEN App*.  
Just like the mini-games on Cabin Biscuit packs, *GHOST GREENS* will combine *physical activities* with *digital engagement* to make healthy eating *fun and rewarding*.

### 📱 The GREEN App

Designed with *educational articles* for both parents and kids, the GREEN App brings *education and fun* into daily life.  
Think Cocomelon — but focused solely on the importance of vegetables and a healthy diet.

But it doesn’t stop there…

The app will also use *AI to curate personalized diets* — helping parents combine the right vegetables in the right proportions for meals.

Users earn *points* for completing articles, games, and quizzes, helping both *children and parents* learn and stay engaged.

> *GHOST GREENS* blends creativity, health, and critical thinking.  
> It transforms mealtime into a fun, brain-stimulating, and family-bonding experience.

## 💭 REFLECTION

When the idea first came up, I knew it wouldn’t just be digital —  
there had to be a *physical product*.  
Once that was clear, the first draft of the product design came to mind — followed by the *why* behind it.

### Why should parents patronize me?
How do we make this a product that customers relate to and want to use?

We decided to make it *interactive, designed to both **educate* and *engage* families:
- Video and audio articles for parents and kids  
- Interactive games for children  
- Encrypted codes and notes inside packages for extra in-app points  

Developing this product made me realize something:  
> Using force or trickery isn’t the best way to get children to eat their veggies.  
> By incorporating *fun, **rewards, and **playful interactions*, parents can naturally encourage participation and learning.
